# Credit Model Validation Skill

## Overview
This skill is designed to automate the credit risk model validation process for banking institutions in Kazakhstan. It focuses on evaluating model performance using key metrics that are essential for ensuring regulatory compliance and overall model effectiveness.

## Key Metrics
- **AUC (Area Under the Curve)**: Measures the ability of the model to distinguish between positive and negative cases.
- **Gini Coefficient**: A statistical measure of distribution, often used to assess the discriminatory power of the model.
- **Recall**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all actual positives.
- **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
- **F1 Score**: The weighted average of Precision and Recall, providing a balance between the two.
- **KS Statistic**: Measures the separation between the positive and negative distributions.
- **PSI (Population Stability Index)**: Assesses changes in the population over time, indicating model stability.
- **CSI (Cumulative Accuracy Profile)**: A measure of model performance.

## Regulatory Compliance
This skill ensures that the validation process adheres to the regulatory standards set forth for financial institutions in Kazakhstan, helping banks to maintain compliance while effectively managing credit risk.
